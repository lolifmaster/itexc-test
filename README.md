# Healthy24. Landing Page

landing page built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite, and Shadcn-UI.

## My choices ?

- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture, efficient virtual DOM, large ecosystem, and declarative syntax.

- **TypeScript**: Selected for static type checking, improved code maintainability, and seamless integration with React.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Opted for its utility-first approach, rapid development using pre-defined classes, responsive design support, high customizability, and optimized CSS output.

- **Vite**: Utilized as a fast and minimalist build tool, providing a lightning-fast development experience, hot module replacement, and optimized production builds.

- **Shadcn-UI**: Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.
